# Data structures and algorithms

<div style="text-align: centre"><img src="/avl.gif" width="500" height="220"/></div>

A collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Python to demonstrate my understanding of core computer science concepts.

So far, the focus has been on data structures, with the plan to look further at common algorithms in the future.

### Contains working examples of:
- Stack
- Queue
- Circular queue
- Dynamic circular queue
- Heap
- Binary tree
- Binary search tree
- AVL self balancing binary search tree
